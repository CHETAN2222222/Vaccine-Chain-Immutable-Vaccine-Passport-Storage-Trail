# Vaccine Chain: Immutable Vaccine Passport & Storage Trail

## Project Description

Vaccine Chain is a revolutionary blockchain-based platform that creates an immutable, transparent, and secure system for recording, storing, and verifying vaccination records. Built on Ethereum using Solidity smart contracts, this platform ensures that vaccination data cannot be tampered with while maintaining patient privacy and enabling seamless verification across healthcare systems, travel authorities, and employers.

The platform creates a permanent, auditable trail of all vaccine administrations, from manufacture to patient delivery, ensuring authenticity and preventing fraud in vaccination certificates.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to establish a global, interoperable vaccination verification system that:

- **Eliminates Vaccine Fraud**: Creates an immutable ledger that prevents fake vaccination certificates
- **Enables Global Mobility**: Provides universally accepted vaccination proof for international travel
- **Protects Patient Privacy**: Uses blockchain technology to secure sensitive medical data
- **Builds Public Trust**: Offers transparent verification while maintaining individual privacy
- **Supports Public Health**: Enables real-time tracking of vaccination coverage and effectiveness

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Hardhat or Truffle
- MetaMask wallet
- Ethereum testnet ETH

### Smart Contract Deployment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vaccine-chain.git
cd vaccine-chain

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy to testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia

# Verify contract
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env

# Add your configuration
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_infura_id
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_key
```

## Usage Examples

### Register as Healthcare Provider
```javascript
await vaccineChain.registerHealthcareProvider(
    "City General Hospital",
    "MD123456789"
);
```

### Record Vaccination
```javascript
await vaccineChain.recordVaccination(
    patientAddress,
    encryptedPatientId,
    "COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine",
    "Pfizer-BioNTech",
    "EL9261",
    "New York, NY",
    1,
    ipfsHash
);
```

### Verify Vaccination Record
```javascript
const record = await vaccineChain.verifyVaccineRecord(recordId);
console.log(record);
```

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive data is encrypted before storage
- Multi-signature requirements for critical operations
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Compliance with HIPAA and GDPR regulations
- Gas optimization to prevent DoS attacks
